    """
    Returns a list of prime numbers below the number "entry":
    In the algorithm:
    All remainders are modulo-sixty remainders (divide the number by 2*2*3*5=60 and return the remainder). Using modulo-sixty we can easily see how it will skip multiples of 2, 3, and 5.
    All numbers, including x and y, are positive integers.
    Flipping an entry in the sieve list means to change the marking (prime or nonprime that translates to True and False respectively) to the opposite marking.
    This results in numbers with an odd number of solutions to the corresponding equation being potentially prime (prime if they are also square free),
    and numbers with an even number of solutions being composite(non primes).
